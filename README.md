# HTTP Problem Type Registration Requests

This repository's issues list manages requests to add and change entries in the [HTTP Probem Types Registry]([REGISTRY_LINK](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types/http-problem-types.xhtml)). Please note our [contribution terms](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Your [Experts](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8126#section-4.6) are currently [@mnot](https://github.com/mnot) and [@sdatspun2](https://github.com/sdatspun2).

To request registration of a problem type (or a change to an existing one), you can:

* [File an issue](https://github.com/protocol-registries/http-problem-types/issues/new/choose) (preferred), or
* Send e-mail to [the mailing list]([MAILING_LIST_LINK](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/httpapi)).

See [RFC 9457](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc9457) for more information; in particular, the [requirements for registration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html#name-registered-problem-types).

Once approved, your request will be incorporated into the IANA registry, whereupon it will be officially registered.
